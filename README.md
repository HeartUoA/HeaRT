# Welcome to HeaRT
We need a marketing genius to write us a brilliant sell story on HeaRT. Because it's just me writing this, sorry.
Below you'll find instructions on how to set everything up. In the end, you should have the button called "Test Endpoint"
in the frontend client work and return "John Doe, teaches the course: SOFTENG 700"

## Frontend instructions

```
yarn start-client
```
